      "abstract": "The co-existence of various kinds of devices, protocols, architectures, and programming languages make Internet of Things (IoT) systems complex to develop, even for experienced programmers. Perforce, Software Engineering challenges are even more difficult to address by novice programmers. Previous research focused on identifying the most challenging issues that novice programmers experience when developing IoT systems. The results suggested that the integration of heterogeneous software components resulted one of the most painful issues, mainly due to the lack of documentation understandable by inexperienced developers, from both conceptual and technical perspectives. In fact, novice programmers devote a significant effort looking for documentation and code samples willing to understand them conceptually, or in the worst case, at least to make them work. Driven by the research question: \\\"How do the lessons learned by IoT novice programmers can be captured, so they become an asset for other novice developers?\\\", in this paper, we introduce Code Recipes. They consist of summarized and well-defined documentation modules, independent from programming languages or run-time environments, by which non-expert programmers can smoothly become familiar with source code, written by other developers that faced similar issues. Through a use case, we show how Code Recipes are a feasible mechanism to support novice IoT programmers in building their IoT systems",

The aim of this work is to identify the requirements and propose the design of a Smart Study Room that, besides relying on users' awareness about their energy consumption, might also rely on their feedback about issues that could affect the optimal use of the study room resources. This concept is presented in the paper as two-way awareness. To determine the requirements, a survey was conducted among 61 university students to understand: (i) their usual behavior at the study room; (ii) their complaints about the study room; (iii) the set of users' behaviors that, in their opinion, have a negative impact on the energy consumption; and (iv) the information of the study room that they would find useful and interesting to visualize. Based on the results of this survey the design of the smart study room was developed and presented.",

The exploratory study was conducted among undergraduate students, that worked in groups for developing AmI projects during a university course. Based on their own experiences, individually and as a group, the pain points were identified and prioritized over a common architecture and a set of software development activities. The quantification of the pain points was based on the difficulty level that the students perceived on the development activities and the time they spent completing them. Results represent a starting point for the design of tools and methodologies targeted at overcoming the complexity that novice programmers face when developing AmI systems.",

      "abstract": "As part of Enterprise Architecture projects, models are built using different languages and tools to document and analyze the state of business and IT. However, models are just intermediate assets: deliverables are the actual outputs, but they are typically hand built using information from the models, and following the structures specified in EA methods. This requires manual effort, is error-prone, and results in artifacts that might be out-of-date very quickly. This paper addresses this by making a proposal to support the semi-automated generation of EA deliverables using a scripting Domain Specific Language for the creation of deliverable templates.",

      "abstract": "Background: The use of mobile applications in dermatology to support remote diagnosis is becoming more important each day, particularly in rural areas where dermatology services are commonly managed by healthcare personnel with no speciality training. Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the reliability of mobile applications to support remote dermatological diagnosis, when used together with a dermatological ontology in underprivileged areas. Methods: A mobile application that allows characterization of skin lesions was developed. The experiment was conducted in a remote area without access to a dermatologist. A total of 64 dermatological queries were recorded in the mobile application. Results: The results showed that the probability of obtaining a correct diagnosis was between 64.4% and 85.6% and a confidence interval of 95%. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the implementation of a Teledermatology strategy based on mobile applications and domain ontology-driven knowledge base to provide timely assistance to healthcare professionals. This approach was found to be pertinent in the Colombian rural context, particularly in forest regions where dermatology specialists are not available.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sexual risk behaviors associated with poor information on sexuality have contributed to major public health problems in the area of sexual and reproductive health in teenagers and young adults in Colombia. Objective: To report our experience with the use of DoctorChat Mobile to provide sexual education and information among university students in Bogota, Colombia, and knowledge about the sexual risk factors detected among them. Methods: A mobile app that allows patients to ask about sexual and reproductive health issues was developed. Sexual and reproductive risk behaviors in a sample of young adults were measured before and after the use of the app through the validated survey Family Health International (FHI) Behavioral Surveillance Survey (BSS) for Use With Adults Between 15 and 49 Years. A nonprobabilistic convenience recruitment was undertaken through the study´s webpage. After completing the first survey, participants were allowed to download and use the app for a 6-month period (intervention), followed by completion of the same survey once again. For the inferential analysis, data was divided into 3 groups (dichotomous data, discrete quantitative data, and ordinal data) to compare the results of the questions between the first and the second survey. The study was carried out with a sample of university students between 18 and 29 years with access to mobile phones. Participation in the study was voluntary and anonymous. Results: A total of 257 subjects met the selection criteria. The preintervention survey was answered by 232 subjects, and 127 of them fully answered the postintervention survey. In total, 54.3% (69\/127) of the subjects completed the survey but did not use the app, leaving an effective population of 58 subjects for analysis. Of these subjects, 53% (31\/58) were women and 47% (27\/58) were men. The mean age was 21 years, ranging between 18 and 29 years. The differences between the answers from both surveys were not statistically significant. The main sexual risk behaviors identified in the population were homosexual intercourse, nonuse of condoms, sexual intercourse with nonregular and commercial partners, the use of psychoactive substances, and lack of knowledge on symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV transmission. Conclusions: Although there were no differences between the pre- and postintervention results, the study revealed different risk behaviors among the participating subjects. These findings highlight the importance of promoting high-impact educational strategies on this matter and the importance of providing teenagers and young adults with easily accessible tools with reliable health information, regardless of their socioeconomic status.",
